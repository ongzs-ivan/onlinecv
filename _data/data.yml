career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      <p> 
      I'm a video game developer with 4 years of experience working in a professional environment. <br>
      With an accumulative experience of 4+ years with Unity, 3+ years with Unreal Engine and a love for what I do, I'm quite confident in my job.
      </p>

      <p> 
      While I don't pride myself a genius, I am well-versed in common and best practices with coding such as OOP, DSA, memory usage, all of which help me to write more optimized code.
      Not to mention concepts more specific to game development, where my main interest lies in character AI systems (especially state machines).
      </p>

      <p>
      As someone who is driven by clear objectives and guidelines, as long as there is a proper goal, I can easily handle tasks that come my way even if it is out of my comfort zone.
      For example, despite not being a social person, I have no problems expressing my opinion and discussing a task with others to determine an optimal solution.
      </p>
