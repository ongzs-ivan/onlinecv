career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      <p> 
      I'm a video game developer with 4 years of experience working in a professional environment.
      With over 4 years of hands-on experience in Unity and 3 years in Unreal Engine, I've developed a solid foundation in programming and a strong, lasting passion for game development.
      </p>

      <p> 
      I'm well-versed in core programming concepts such as <strong>OOP</strong>, <strong>DSA</strong> and <strong>memory management</strong>, and I have considerable experience with <strong>debugging</strong>.
      While I've worked on a range of features, my primary interest lies in developing more intelligent and responsive <strong>character AI</strong>—particularly through well-designed state machines.
      </p>

      <p>
      I am capable of <strong>managing tasks</strong> effectively, particularly when guided by clear objectives and well-defined guidelines—even when working outside my comfort zone.
      Although I tend to be introverted, I make a consistent effort to communicate my ideas clearly while collaborating with the team to reach optimal solutions.
      </p>
